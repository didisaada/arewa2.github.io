            <h1>We are the first ever arewa shopping website</h1>
            <p> Our website was founded by a group of passionate individuals who wanted to share the
                 unique culture and heritage of Northern Nigeria with the world. We grew up in this
                 region and have always been fascinated by its rich history, diverse people, and beautiful
                 landscapes. We started this website as a way to showcase the amazing products that are 
                 created and sold in this region, and to help support the local artisans and entrepreneurs 
                 who make them. We believe that by sharing these products with the world, we can help to
                 preserve the traditions and customs of Northern Nigeria for generations to come.
                 Thank you for being a part of our journey!</p>
